# Computer Network & Network Reference Model

## Overview of Computer Network

### Networks
+ What is a network?
    + A network is an intricately connected system of objects,devices, or people
+ Companies created networks
    + As companies expanded, the need for connecting network at different sites became very important
  
### Data Networks Classifications
+ LAN(Local Area Networks)
+ WAN(Wide Area Networks)

### LAN/WAN

+ Local Area Networks(LANs)
    + Operate locally(cover small areas)
    + Multi-user access
    + High speeds expected(up to Gbps/10Gbps)
    + Error rae is easily controlled
+ Wide Area Networks(WANs)
    + Operate over larger areas
    + Access over serial links,optical links, etc
    + Traditionally, have Lower speeds
    + Error rate can not be easily controlled

### Internet

+ internet：
    + A network whose nodes are networks
+ Internet
    + The largest, open, interconnected computer network in the world
    + TCP/IP is the reference model of Internet
    + Evolved from ARPANET

### Internet with Multi-layer ISP structure
+ Internet Service Provides(ISP)

### LAN Devices
+ Hub-Multiport repeater,connects PCs; Repeats signals
+ Bridge-LAN segmentation; MAC addresses
+ Switch-Multi-bridge; Full bandwidth
+ Router-Path determination; Packet switch


### WAN Devices
+ Router-Path determination; Packet switching
+ Modem CSU/DSU TA/NT1- Analog to digital; Remote LAN connections

## OSI Reference Model

### OSI(Open System Interconnection) Model
+ Proposed by International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
+ A network model that help network builders implement networks that could communicate and work together
+ Describes how information or data moves from one computer through a network to another computer
+ a layered communication process
    + Each layer performs a specific task
  
### The OSI Reference Model
Each layer has a unique function
```
7. Application   -> User interface
6. Presentation  -> Data presentation and encryption
5. Session       -> Inter-host connection
4. Transport     -> End-to-end connections
3. Network       -> Addresses and best path
2. Data Link     -> Access to media
1. Physical      -> Binary transmission
```

### Why a Layered Model?
+ Reduce Complexity
+ standardizes interfaces
+ Facilitates modular engineering
+ Ensures interoperable technology
+ Accelerates evolution
+ Simplifies teaching and learning
